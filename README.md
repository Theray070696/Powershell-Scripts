Hello there!

These are a handful of scripts I've written at my IT job and in my free time to make my life easier, and I hope some of them can make your life easier!

If a script requires another script from this repo, they're listed in the header.

If you use any of the code/scripts, I ask that you please include a link to this repository in the source code. I'd really appreciate it :)
